# GUIDED PROJECT OF DATAQUEST: Creating An Efficient Data Analysis Workflow

# In this guided project, we will be acting as a data analyst for a company that
 # sells books for learning programming. Your company has produced multiple books,
 # and each has received many reviews. Your company wants us to check out the
 # sales data and see if we can extract any useful information from it.


# Getting Familiar With The Data ----

library(tidyverse)

dataset <- read_csv("data/book_reviews.csv")

dim(dataset)
colnames(dataset)

str(dataset)
glimpse(dataset)
head(dataset)

# review should be an ordered factor
# books' names should be in skake_case

is.na(dataset) # there are some NAs

# using a for loop to see the data type of the dataset
for (col in dataset) {
  data <- typeof(col)
  print(data)
}

# let's find unique values for each column
unique(dataset$book)
unique(dataset$review) # there are NA values
unique(dataset$state) # California and CA, Texas and TX are the same states
unique(dataset$price)


# Handling Missing Data ----

# Let's remove the NA rows, we have 2 options
dataset %>% 
  filter(is.na(review)) # I'm going to remove 206 rows with missing values
drop_na(dataset, review)
book_reviews <- dataset %>% 
  filter(!is.na(review)) %>% 
  glimpse()


# Dealing With Inconsistent Labels ----

# I prefer postal codes
book_reviews <- book_reviews %>%
  mutate(
    state = case_when(
      state == "California" ~ "CA",
      state == "New York" ~ "NY",
      state == "Texas" ~ "TX",
      state == "Florida" ~ "FL",
      TRUE ~ state # ignore cases where it's already postal code
  )) %>% 
  glimpse()

unique(book_reviews$state)


# Transforming The Review Data ----

book_reviews <- book_reviews %>%
  mutate(
    review_num = case_when(
      review == "Poor" ~ 1,
      review == "Fair" ~ 2,
      review == "Good" ~ 3,
      review == "Great" ~ 4,
      review == "Excellent" ~ 5
    )
    ) %>% 
  glimpse()


unique(book_reviews$review_num)

# Let's put review as an ordered factor
book_reviews <- book_reviews %>%
  mutate(
    review = as.factor(review)
    ) %>%
  mutate(
    review = ordered(review, levels = c("Poor",
                                        "Fair",
                                        "Good",
                                        "Great",
                                        "Excellent")
                     )
    ) %>% 
  glimpse()
str(book_reviews$review)

# New column
book_reviews <- book_reviews %>%
  mutate(
    is_high_review = if_else(review_num >= 4, TRUE, FALSE)
  ) %>% 
  glimpse()


# Analyzing The Data ----

# The most profitable book should be the one that generates more money

# I'll show the prices of each book

prices <- c(50.00, 39.99, 29.99, 19.99, 15.99)
books_prices <- as_tibble(cbind(book, prices))
books_prices <- books_prices %>% 
  mutate(
    prices = as.double(prices)
  )

# The operation of assigning the right price to the books could be done by joining

merge.data.frame(books_profit, books_prices)
books_profit <- left_join(books_profit, books_prices)
